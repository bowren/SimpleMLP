SimpleMLP is a free softare multilayer peceptron implemenation.
It was orignally written to understand the perceptron algorithm.
The OCR example that comes with it converges to a solution within
seconds because the data set contains letters drawn with thick
lines, so there are more black pixels and are easier to learn.
Training on thinly drawn letters would require more trainning
examples and time.
